    "This was a Crypto challenge from Day 2 of the Black Hat MEA CTF Finals, written by Polymero. The challenge file can be found [here](ecpc.py), but I will also describe a high-level overview of the challenge here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup is [ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) on [Curve25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519), which has the following parameters:\n",
    "- The curve $E$ is $y^2 = x^3+486662x^2+x$ on the field $\\textrm{GF}(p)$ with $p=2^{255}-19$.\n",
    "- The base point $G$ has $G_x=9$. This generates a cyclic subgroup of prime order $n \\approx \\frac{p}{8}$.\n",
    "- A private key $d$ is randomly generated, but the public key $Q=dG$ is never revealed to us.\n",
    "- The hash function is $h(m) = \\textrm{sha256}(Q\\|m)$, which depends on the unknown parameter $Q$.\n",
    "- To sign a message $m$, a random $k$ is generated and the signature is $(r,s) = \\left( (kG)_x \\bmod{n}, k^{-1}(h+rd) \\bmod{n} \\right)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the challenge is basically as follows:\n",
    "- We are given the hash of the empty string, i.e. $h_0 := \\textrm{sha256}(Q)$. This is called the Connection ID. We are not given $Q$ itself.\n",
    "- The flag is represented as a stream of bits, and then for each bit:\n",
    "    - If the bit is set, we are given a random signature $(r, s)$ of the message $m=1$.\n",
    "    - If the bit is unset, we are given a random element of $\\mathbb{Z}_n^2$.\n",
    "- We have a signature oracle which can spit out a valid signature $(r, s)$ for any message $m$ that we give it.\n",
    "- The job is to recover the flag, i.e. by distinguishing the valid signatures of $m=1$ from the random pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or at least, that was the original challenge, which we will call Level 1. Part of the purpose of this write-up is to keep adding levels to make it increasingly difficult but still solvable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by importing the usual modules, and just defining a bunch of useful helper functions."

    "## Level 6: Level 5 + No $s$ provided\n",
    "\n",
    "Surprise! This turns out to be the easiest of the lot. With no $s$ provided, we cannot actually verify if a signature is valid, and are reduced to distinguishing whether a given $r$ is the possible x-coordinate (mod $n$) of some $kG$, or if it's merely random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some quick handwavy maths shows that roughly half of all values of $x$ can be lifted to $E$. But we have a cofactor of 8 here which means that our given value of $r$ can be unprojected to 8 values of $x$, which you would think gives it a $\\frac{1}{256}$ chance of getting identified as a random value.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the cofactor is a double-edged sword here, as the full curve $E$ actually has $8n$ points, so there's only a $\\frac{1}{8}$ probability that a given $x$ is in fact on our order-$n$ subgroup. This means that the set of all possible x-coordinates of $kG$ only covers roughly $\\frac{1}{16}$ of $\\textrm{GF}(p)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also means that the probability that a random $r$ can be identified as being random is $\\left(1-\\frac{1}{16}\\right)^8 \\approx 59.7\\%$, and you can test this by simply lifting all possible $x$ values and seeing if any of them satisfy $nP=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us a probabilistic way to recover out flag:\n",
    "- Start with the bitstream consisting of all 1s.\n",
    "- Run the process, which will turn roughly 60\\% of the actual 0s into a 0 on our side.\n",
    "- Run a second time, so that now roughly 84\\% of the actual 0s have become a 0 on our side.\n",
    "- If we run it 10 times, this increases to 99.99\\%.\n",
    "- If we run it 20 times, this increases to 99.999999\\%.\n",
    "\n",
    "So depending on your probabilistic tolerance, running 10 times in pretty good for a regular-sized flag, but 20 times should cover just about every case."
